# hello-world

At first I was _afraid_... I was **petrified**
in thinking I would never live without you by my side.
But then I spent so many night thinking how you did me wrong
and `I grew strong` and I learned how to get along.

Action points are:
- getting it all done and over with
- learning the most of github
