# hello-world

At first I was _afraid_... I was **petrified**
in thinking I would never live without you: ST4
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
and I grew `strong` and I learned how to get alooong...

Action points are:
- getting something done
- trying hard not to sleep
